      h2.gamma The Swiss JavaScript community event
      
      p SwissJS is a <strong>one day, one track JavaScript conference</strong> organized for the
        | community by the community. Members of all Swiss JavaScript user groups 
        | will either speak or attend this event.
      p SwissJS is the only event that gets all the leading Swiss JavaScript 
        | developers into a room for an entire day. It is where they finally get
        | to meet in person.
      p After the initial success of the first event in 2012, the 2014 edition
        | of SwissJS turned into an extraordinary event with <strong>over 150 attendees</strong>
        | from all over Switzerland and six talks by local developers.

      h1.gamma Sponsors
      
      p As a sponsor of SwissJS you reach pretty much <strong>all of the 
        | who-is-who in the Swiss JavaScript community.</strong> While the event
        | is limited to a single day for 200 people, experience show that it will 
        | resonate throughout social media for several weeks.
      p Sponsors will be shown on the projector between talks and 
        | <strong>regularly mentioned by the MC</strong> of the event.
      p In order to add a bit of viral after-marketing, SwissJS will release 
        | a <strong>professionally shot video</strong> of the event, capturing 
        | the mood rather than the content. <strong>Sponsors will be thanked in 
        | the video too.</strong>
