      h1 Lightning talks
      
      h3 The format:
      p Lightning talks are one of the most loved format of the event. Anyone gets a chance to talk about their pet project, a cool technique they want to share or the most useless JS feature.

      p We keep talks short to give many people a chance to talk. We'll interrupt you if you take more than 10 minutes

      h3 The submission:
      p You can submit a talk until the same day of the event. There's 4 to 8 slots available. First come, first served.

      p You still need a ticket to attend the event. Besides the 10min of fame you will get a small thank you reward for your talk.

      h3 The rules:
      ul
        li No selling / marketing talk.
        li Respect our code of conduct.
