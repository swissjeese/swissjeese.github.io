                    <h2>Yes We Can: Rendering PDFs cross browser without plugins!</h2>
                    This talk is about PDF.JS - a project that aims to implement a full PDF viewer using only open web standards; that means only JavaScript, CSS and HTML5. Once started as an experiment to figure out, what the web is capable of doing and what needs to get improved in the web platform, the project is about to become the default PDF viewer in Firefox. But as the viewer is nothing more then a normal web page, the viewer also works in Google Chrome, IE(9+) as well as Opera.

                    Front-end heavy applications grow more and more complex. As frontend developers we need strategies to overcome those complexities.
                        In this talk we'll see, how the YUI3 App Framework assists us in doing so: It helps us writing structured and thus maintainable code. Of course we will also have a look at the drawbacks of the framework and when you should not use it.

With the new generation of browsers and their related new JavaScript engine, we can build new incredible user experience for the users. Our vision is to empower users to express themselves on the web by leveraging the power of HTML-5. I enjoy the fact that Webdoc everyday brings its pack of challenges as we have key users such as Nirvana, Britney Spears, Robbie Williams, Pink Floyd and WWF that are using it to engage with their fans and regularly stressing and sometimes crashing our servers!

                    <h2>WebApp = MVC javascript + javascript templating + JSON API</h2>
                    Using the case of webdoc.com, we will present the challenges and the solutions we chose to build a scalable HTML-5 based social media platform. The main challenge was to provide a sleek and powerful client-side JS WebApp that allows users to mix web content such as video from YouTube, sounds from SoundClouds and interactive widget such as Google maps and polls through drag & drops in a social media environment.
                        WebApps move the model to the client-side to improve the user experience and enable fast dynamic interactions while not reloading the web page. The aim of the presentation is to present the JavaScript MVC framework we have developed and its integration in our global architecture that includes Rails-mySQL-MongoDB.

                    As our applications begin to reach a more and more international audience and as Unicode gains interesting characters like the good old U+1F4A9, the times where developers could cheat their way using ISO-8859-1 are slowly coming to an end.
                        But what does it mean to go Unicode? What support does JS provide? What do you have to keep in mind as you exit the cosy world of what-you-think-is-ISO-8859-1-but-likely-isn't? What is the one huge flaw in what JS claims to be Unicode support?
